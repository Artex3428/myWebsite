About me

Hi, my name is Alexander. I'm a 19-year-old from Sweden, and I created this website to give you a glimpse of who I am, so let’s dive in!

I'm a web developer, and I've been working in the field for almost 4 years. I started when I was 14, and I'm still passionate about it today. Web development is something I truly love.

Another passion of mine is C++, which I've been learning and practicing for nearly a year. However, I decided to set it aside for now to focus more on web development.
